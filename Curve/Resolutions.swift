// then we define the resolution: currentXResolution, which is the span per 1 screen width, should be multiplies of : maxXAxisValues
// this value (currentXResolution) can be changed when user pick a new resolution
// this value only show the span per 1 screen width, but we can set the overall span to be multiple screens x2,x3 currentXResolution
